== Container Management with Ansible

Containers can now be managed with the Ansible Podman collection leveraging Ansible Automation Plaatform (AAP). Red Hat curates and maintains several supported Ansible Collections at Ansible Automation Hub. The community collections are available to be installed from Ansible Galaxy.

=== Ansible Refresher

The following is a small reminder about Ansible and the basics around an Ansible Control node for managing systems with Ansible.

==== Ansible Basics

In order to use Ansible, the following items are required:

* *ansible* is installed on the Control Node
* An *ansible.cfg* file exists and points to a working inventory
* An *inventory* file exists containing managed nodes

===== Ansible Concepts and Architecture

.Ansible Machine Types

* *Control Node*: Location where Ansible is installed and used to run playbooks and execute Ansible ad-hoc commands

* *Managed Host*: Network device that is managed by an Ansible control node

The required Ansible components are the following:

* *ansible.cfg*: Ansible configuration file with directives on how Ansible should work

* *inventory*: Listing and organization of ansible managed nodes/hosts

* *module*: Small piece of code to perform a variety of tasks (generally written in Python or Powershell)

* *plugins*: Code that can be used to extend and adapt Ansible to new uses. Capable of manipulating data and extracting information from output. (_Used more in the next course DO447_)

* *Ansible Tower/API*: Framework to control and manage Ansible at scale. Ansible Tower is not a core part of Ansible, but is an add-on product to more effectively utilize Ansible with teams.

image::architecture-ansible.png[title="Ansible Architecture", align="center"]

===== Building an Ansible Inventory

An *inventory* file is the minimum needed item for Ansible to run. Inventory files provide a listing of hosts for Ansible to manage. There are multiple ways to define an inventory file.


====== Static Inventory

Static inventory files are generally defined in the INI format.

.Simple Inventory
[source,yaml]
----
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
192.0.2.42

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
192.0.2.42

----

===== Ansible Configuration Files

It is important to note, there can be multiple Ansible configuration files. Ansible will look for and process configuration files in order.

====
. Location specified in *ANSIBLE_CONFIG*
. The *ansible.cfg* file in the current working directory
. The *.ansible.cfg* file in the user's home directory
. The default */etc/ansible/ansible.cfg* file
====

NOTE: It is important to note that the first file in this order Ansible sees is what will be used. Therefore, if anything is setup for the *ansible.cfg* file in locations 1-3, it won't ever use the default file *_/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg_*

TIP: *Ansible Configuration file documentation:* http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html


.*Ansible Settings*
[cols=2,cols="2,2",options=header]
|===
|Setting
|Command Line Option

|*inventory*
|Location of the Ansible inventory file.

|*remote_user*
|The remote user account used to establish connections to managed hosts.

|*become*
|Enables or disables privilege escalation for operations on managed hosts.

|*become_method*
|Defines privilege escalation method on managed hosts.

|*become_user*
|User account to escalate privileges to on managed hosts.

|*become_ask_pass*
|Defines whether privilege escalation on managed hosts should prompt for password.

|===

.Ansible Collections
[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with Ansible 2.9 and the new Ansible (AAP), collections have been introduced and allow modules, roles, and other components to be stored in Ansible collections. Similar to Ansible Roles, Ansible Collections must be installed on the system and available for Ansible playbooks.

Ansible Collections can be specified in the *ansible.cfg* file for the path where collections have been installed. As with Ansible Roles, it is common to install Ansible collections to the working directory in a sub-directory called *collections*. When working with Ansible Collections it is necessary to provide this information in the *ansible.cfg* file.

.*ansible.cfg* for Using Collections
[source,yaml]
----
[defaults]
remote_user = root
inventory = inventory
COLLECTIONS_PATHS = ~/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections:./collections

[privilege_escalation]
become = False
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False
----
====

=== Ansible Podman Collection

The Ansible Podman collection is a required component in order to have the Ansible Modules needed to manage containers using Podman. Currently, the *containers.podman* is only available via Ansible Galaxy.

==== Obtaining Podman Collections

In order to leverage Ansible to official manage Podman containers, the *containers.podman* collection must be installed on the Ansible Control node. Currently, there are two main sources for installation of Ansible collections.

.Ansible Collections
* Red Hat supported collections for Ansible can be downloaded from Ansible Automation Hub (https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub).
* Ansible Community collections can be downloaded from Ansible Galaxy (https://galaxy.ansible.com/containers/podman)

.Ansible Automation Hub and Ansible Galaxy
[TIP]
====
It is required that you have a Red Hat Subscription for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP2.0) in order to access Red Hat Supported Ansible collections. The lab and exercises will use the Ansible Galaxy Podman collection.

.Installing Ansible Galaxy Podman Collection
[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install containers.podman
----

.*containers.podman* Documentation

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/containers/podman/index.html
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/containers/podman/podman_container_module.html
====

==== Installing and Using the *containers.podman* Collection

There are multiple methods for the Podman collection to be installed, however, for this course and the exercises, the collection will be installed locally to the *./collections* sub-folder using a requirements.yml file. The *ansible.cfg* will point to this as already available in the path and the Ansible playbooks being utilized will reference the *collections* at the top of the playbook similar to Ansible roles so that throughout the playbook tasks, the shorter module name can be referenced.

.*LAB: Installing the _containers.podman_ Collection*
====

.Installing the Podman Collection

Similar to installation of Ansible Roles, Ansible Collections can be installed in the local working directory in a sub-directory called *collections*. The collections needed for the Ansible projects can be specified in a *requirements.yml* file and installed just like Ansible Roles.

.Using Collections
[TIP]
====
Referencing the *collection* and using shorter module names. This allows a cleaner and more streamlined approach and is generally consistent with the older Ansible versions. It is 100% fully acceptable to utilize the fully qualified module names, however, for the course and ease of use we will continue referencing Ansible modules by the shortened/condensed name.

==== Analyzing Running Containers with Ansible

The *podman collection* has several components to manage and collect information from containers. The *podman_container_info* module can be used to get information about running containers. It requires the name of the container and collects all information as a list/dictionary.

.Podman Container Info Module
[TIP]
====
It is important to note that many of the Ansible *fact* modules have been replaced with *info* modules so the facts are returned as lists/dictionaries. You should consult each module's information page and examine the *Return Values* section.

*podman_container_info*: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/containers/podman/podman_container_info_module.html#ansible-collections-containers-podman-podman-container-info-module

It is also important to know that in order to access specific elements from the information returned, a mapping of the value must be performed.
