# **DO180 extras**
Unlike the DO285 course, where timings are a constraint, in my opinion there is space in the DO180 for some additional content.

Here it's the extra material I've prepared so far and that I'm currently using in my DO180 courses:

- [buildah-operations](./buildah-operations), as an additional paragraph in ch. 5, **Creating Custom Container Images**
- [manage-pod](./manage-pod), as an additional paragraph in either ch. 3, **Managing Containers** or in ch. 7, **Deploying Multi-Container
  Applications**.

All example scripts are intended to run on the **workstation** vm without modifications on system config files. Simply log in to the console and clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sstagnaro/rht-contrib.git
```

Then navigate to the **do180** directory:

```
$ cd rht-contrib/do180
```
