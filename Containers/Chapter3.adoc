== Podman Pods

*Podman* has replaced *Docker/Moby* in RHEL 8 and will be the container management application moving forward. *Podman* (short for Pod Manager) is a daemon-less way to run containers and pods as a standard non-privileged user or as a privileged or "root" user. Podman also lends itself nicely to Kubernetes since it manages both containers and pods. Remember that the smallest item that Kubernetes/Openshift manages is a pod and that pods consist of one or more containers.

=== Using and Leveraging Pods with Podman

Generally the concept of pod is associated with orchestration tools such as Red Hat Openshift and Kubernetes. A pod is a collection of one or more containers and will always include an *Infrastructure* or *Infra* container. The *Infra* container is meant to serve as a placeholder for the namespace allowing the pod to remain while allowing containers to be stopped and started while the pod stays running.

image::Chapter3-93594.png[title="Example of a Pod", align="center"]

When using *pods* port bindings and network port mapping is done at the *pod* level, therefore this is assigned to the *infra* container. In order to change and modify ports on the container, it is necessary to delete the *pod* as once resources have been assigned, they can't be changed.

Podman is capable of managing pods with the *podman pod* command. It is possible to get assistance and help from *podman* directly by using the *podman pod --help* command.

.*podman* Pod Management
[source,bash]
----
[root@server ~]# podman pod --help
Manage pods

Description:
  Pods are a group of one or more containers sharing the same network, pid and ipc namespaces.

Usage:
  podman pod [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create a new empty pod
  exists      Check if a pod exists in local storage
  inspect     Displays a pod configuration
  kill        Send the specified signal or SIGKILL to containers in pod
  pause       Pause one or more pods
  prune       Remove all stopped pods and their containers
  ps          List pods
  restart     Restart one or more pods
  rm          Remove one or more pods
  start       Start one or more pods
  stats       Display a live stream of resource usage statistics for the containers in one or more pods
  stop        Stop one or more pods
  top         Display the running processes of containers in a pod
  unpause     Unpause one or more pods
----

Additional more detailed help is available by using the *podman pod <command> --help* for command specific help.

.*podman pod stop* Help
[source,bash]
----
[root@server ~]# podman pod stop --help
Stop one or more pods

Description:
  The pod name or ID can be used.

  This command will stop all running containers in each of the specified pods.

Usage:
  podman pod stop [options] POD [POD...]

Examples:
  podman pod stop mywebserverpod
  podman pod stop --latest
  podman pod stop --time 0 490eb 3557fb

Options:
  -a, --all                       Stop all running pods
  -i, --ignore                    Ignore errors when a specified pod is missing
  -l, --latest                    Act on the latest container podman is aware of
                                  Not supported with the "--remote" flag

==== Creating a Pod and Adding a Container

Podman pods are created just like containers. It is possible to skip the *podman pod create* command to create the pod and then subsequently run the pod with the *podman pod run* command. Instead, you can directly use the *podman pod run* command to create and run the pod. When creating a pod with a container as a single command, you MUST use the *new:<name>* directives to name a new Pod letting *podman* know you aren't attempting to reuse an existing Pod.

==== Cleaning up Pods and Containers

It is necessary to do cleanup and maintenance on Pods and Containers as this doesn't occur automatically with Podman as it does with Openshift/Kubernetes. Just as with managing regular containers, managing pods requires stopping and deleting Pods before those pods can be removed.

It is possible to delete and remove the pod and running containers in a single instance. In order to delete and remove pods, it is necessary to know the names and status of pods which can be found with the *podman pod ps* command.

=== Podman Image and Container Pruning

It is extremely important to cleanup containers, pods, and container images/volumes when the containers are no longer running as resources are prevented from being used even if the container is stopped. More importantly, it is important from a systems management and maintenance standpoint.

==== Using Podman Prune Commands

The *podman <subsystem> prune* command can remove and cleanup Pods, containers, container images, and volumes. This command can be useful as it will only cleanup what isn't being used. For example, if containers are stopped, but will be re-run at a later point, there is no reason to cleanup a volume or the container image because the image is being used, even if it is being used by a stopped container.

===== Cleaning Up Images

.Image Management

Image management is extremely important when using Podman as there are a limited number of resources on the system - namely storage space. Having a good strategy for container cleanup is needed in order to ensure a healthy system. The *podman image prune* command can be used to cleanup and remove all orphaned images not being used by containers. The *podman rmi* command is used to delete actual tagged images from the local image registry.

.Cleanup of Images
[source,bash]
----

----

.Image Cleanup
[IMPORTANT]
====
It will always be necessary to cleanup images after a pod or a container cleanup because there could be *orphaned* and *dangling* images left after all stopped pods and containers have been pruned. This happens if there are images on the system that are unused and have no tags assigned to them.

.Image Cleanup
[TIP]
====
Actual container image cleanup is performed with the *podman rmi ** command which will delete all images that aren't attached to containers. It won't remove any images that are attached to currently running or stopped containers unless the *--force* option is used. However, when using *--force* this will also stop and remove all containers prior to removing the container images.
