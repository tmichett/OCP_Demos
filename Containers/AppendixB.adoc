== System Security Policy and Compliance

System security and compliance is a primary concern for people when thinking about the protection of systems and integrity of data. This set of hands-on procedures will focus on obtaining the content and necessary packages to perform a basic scan and remediate the system based on scan results. As part of the lab, you will be customizing your own SCAP content for a scan, view the results, and generate an Ansible playbook based on the failed results.

=== Customizing SCAP Content

Red Hat includes the SCAP Workbench application as a GUI application which allows scanning, customizing, and saving SCAP scans and results. The SCAP Workbench can be used to perform scans of remote systems over an SSH connection or it can be utilized to scan the local system. Since the SCAP Workbench is a GUI application, it must run on a system with X-Windows installed.


*_Servers to Configure_*

* workstation

*_Packages to Install_*

* scap-workbench

TIP: Since we are using an application on a VM that requires a GUI, we can use X11 forwarding with the SSH connection by specifying a *-X* on the command line.

*Step 1 - SSH to Workstation*

The fist step is to connect to the workstation and forward X11 traffic back to the local system.

.Connecting to the Workstation VM
====
.Connecting to Workstation Using SSH
[source,bash]
----
# ssh root@workstation -X
----
====

*Step 2 - Install Packages*

After connecting to the Workstation VM, you will need to install the SCAP Workbench and its dependencies.

.Installing SCAP Workbench
====
.Using Yum to Install SCAP Workbench

====

*Step 3 - Launching SCAP Workbench*

In order to run a scan or customize SCAP content, you will need to launch the SCAP Workbench application.

TIP: You *must* use SCAP Workbench from a GUI, so it will need to run either locally or through an SSH connection with X11 forwarded.

.Launching SCAP Workbench
====
.Using SCAP Workbench
[source,bash]

====

*Step 4 - Creating Custom Content*

Once SCAP Workbench has been launched, select the content to load. For this lab, we will be using the RHEL7 content.

.Creating Custom Content
====

. For *Select content to load:* select "*RHEL8*", then click "*Load Content*"
. Select the *Profile* you want to use to start customization

TIP: For this example, we will use the *OSPP - Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems* Baseline

image::AppendixA-12524.png[title="SCAP Workbench OSPP Profile", align="center"]

[start=3]
. Click "*Customize*" to create custom SCAP content based on the chosen profile, and give it a name.

image::AppendixA-7cd7e.png[title="SCAP Custom OSPP Profile Creation", align="center"]

TIP: The name for this is: *xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp_customized*

[start=4]
. Click "Deselect All" so that you can select the items you wish to include in your custom scan profile. *NOTE:* we are doing this to also limit it to a few checks for the example.

image::AppendixA-04ed6.png[title="SCAP Custom Profile Selections", align="center"]

NOTE: For this lab, we will be setting the minimum password length and PAM Password quality settings

[start=5]
. Search for Password to set *minimum password length* and set the values in *login.defs*. Check *Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs* and click on the *minimum password legnth* and set the value to *18*

image::AppendixA-1ddf2.png[title="SCAP Custom Profile Password Settings for Login.Defs", align="center"]


[start=6]
. Set password quality requirements with PAM. Search for the minlen and set it to *18*. Also, place a checkbox in *Set Password Quality Requirements with pam_quality*. Then click "OK"

image::AppendixA-09b9f.png[title="SCAP Custom Profile PAM Quality Requirements", align="center"]

[start=7]
. At this point, we have taken the default settings from the OSPP profile with only the tailored pieces that we selected. The next step is to click "File => Save Customization Only" to save the custom content

EXAMPLES
       Evaluate XCCDF content using CPE dictionary and produce html report. In
       this  case  we  use  United  States  Government  Configuration Baseline
       (USGCB) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Desktop.

               oscap xccdf eval --fetch-remote-resources --oval-results \
                       --profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline

*Step 6 - Viewing the SCAP scan report*

After you have transferred the results file to *workstation* you can open the HTML report in a web browser. In this case we will use *_firefox_* to open the file.

.Viewing the SCAP Report
====
.Opening the SCAP HTML Report with Firefox
[source,bash]
----
[root@workstation ~]# firefox Custom_Scan_Report.html
----

image::AppendixA-9416a.png[title="SCAP Scan Results Report in Firefox", align="center"]

WARNING: Firefox may not open the file based on SELinux context triggers. In order to get around this you can use the command prompt and do *setenforce 0* to allow you to open the report.

=== Creating an Ansible Remediation Playbook Based on SCAP Scan Results

The OpenSCAP project and content created by Red Hat can automatically remediate findings from OpenSCAP scans. The findings can be remediated in many ways (*BASH*, *Ansible*, etc.). While things are mostly complete, there are some automated remediations that have not yet been developed.

WARNING: There are multiple automatic remediation methods developed, but at this time, there isn't a script to fix everything.

*_Servers to Configure_*

* servera

NOTE: We will continue to use *workstation* as our master SCAP system as it should have Ansible and SCAP Workbench installed.

*Step 1 - Creating an Ansible Playbook from Results*

The first step will be to generate an Ansible playbook from the SCAP scan results for system remediation.

.Generating Ansible Playbook
====

.Ansible Playbook Generation
[source,bash]
----
[root@workstation ~]# oscap xccdf generate fix \
--profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp_customized \

[WARNING]
.Reviewing Ansible Configurations
====
The *inventory* file provided only has a single host *servera* in there. On real systems, you must be very cautious of running remediation playbooks against an inventory file as it could apply to unintended systems. Additionally the *ansible.cfg* file provided was created for use in this lab environment. Both of these items should be taken into account when doing going through the process on production systems.

[source,bash]

[root@workstation ~]# cat inventory

*Step 3 - Run the Ansible Playbook*

This step will utilize the *workstation* system which is configured as your Ansible management node and will run the playbook to remediate the results on the *servera* system.
