== RHEL 8 Changes

RHEL 8.x brought several significant changes and expanded upon other changes that were introduced as part of the *SystemD* switch in RHEL 7.x. This course will highlight some of the most significant changes and enhancements to RHEL 8.x.

.*RHEL 8.x Enhancements*
* TMUX
* SystemD
* FirewallD

Before beginning the course, there is a quick set of steps that will be completed as an exercise so that the environment can be setup and prepared. The *Workstation* machine will be our GUI machine used throughout the week and is running RHEL 8.2. We will also be using a custom RHEL 8.4 system called *server*.

include::./labs/server_prep/Setup_Exercise.adoc[]

=== TMUX Usage

As part of the upgrade process and package replacement process in RHEL8, several packages have not only been deprecated, they've been completely removed. The *screen* package is one package that is no longer available for installation. Instead, a new terminal program *tmux* has been introduced to provide the *screen* functionality as well as other enhancements.

=== SystemD Overview

==== Understanding SystemD Unit Files and Creating a Service

Starting in RHEL 7, *SystemD* replaced the older style Linux SystemV (sysvinit daemon). This change continued through with RHEL 8 and more systemd tools replaced the traditional legacy tools. This small section will provide references and an overview of how *systemd* can be used to replace the older _init_ scripts that were placed in */etc/init.d/* or some of the other directories.

.Default SystemD Directories
[IMPORTANT]
=====
It is important to note that there are several default SystemD directories. When defining your own files, the proper location is to place them in */etc/systemd*. There is more information available in other Red Hat courses, specifically the RH442 Performance Tuning course.

Default Location: */lib/systemd/*

=== FirewallD

Beginning in RHEL 8.0, Red Hat moved away from *iptables* as the back-end firewall implementation and instead moved to NFTables. However, the introduction of FirewallD and the *firewall-cmd* management commands implemented in RHEL 7.x have evolved and leveraging FirewallD is still the preferred firewall management solution in RHEL 8.x.

==== FirewallD Service Definitions

FirewallD was introduced in RHEL7 as part of the SystemD transition and a new way to manage firewalls without using the underlying firewall implementation (*iptables*). FirewallD with *firewall-cmd* continues to be used in RHEL8 as the preferred method of managing and maintaining firewall rules.

https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/an-introduction-to-firewalld/

https://cheatography.com/mikael-leberre/cheat-sheets/firewall-cmd/
====

==== The *firewall-cmd* Utility

The *firewall-cmd* utility is the primary method to manage and interact with firewall rules on RHEL7/8 systems. The *firewall-cmd* utility supports BASH completion and allows firewall rules to be added based on defined services or by specifying ports/protocols.

.Allowing HTTP through the Firewall by Port/Protocol

.*firewall-cmd* Usage Warning
[WARNING]
====
The *firewall-cmd* utility can be used to make changes to the running firewall as shown in the examples above. This does not make changes to the firewall config file. In order to make the changes to the configuration file, it is necessary to use the *--permanent* options to have the changes written to a file.

When using *--permanent*, and you are not making changes to the current firewall runtime, it is also necessary to use: *firewall-cmd --reload* to reload or load new firewall rules from the firewall configuration file.
====

.Important Header
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to note that presently the Red Hat Web Console (cockpit) only supports management of *firewalld* using defined services.
====

==== FirewallD Files and Locations

FirewallD has a few locations for files both for configuration and usage. As with most configuration files on a Linux system, those rely in */etc/*. The user configurable files for FirewallD also reside in */etc/*. Default configuration files for services, zones, and other FirewallD functionality resides in */usr/lib/firewalld*. This location contains all defined services files and default configuration files for FirewallD and used by the *firewall-cmd* utility.

.FirewallD Configuration Files
[source,bash]
----

==== Defining a Custom Service File

It is possible to define custom *firewalld* service files. These files can be used for your environments for custom applications or custom firewall rules. These service files can also be checked into a version control system such as *git*.

.Creating a Custom Service File using Existing File as Base
[TIP]
====
It is easiest to take an existing service file, copy it to the */etc/firewalld/services* directory, rename and edit the file.
====

. Copy existing FirewallD service file to */etc/firewalld/services*
+
.Using SSH Service File as a Starting Point

----
[root@server ~]# cp /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ssh.xml /etc/firewalld/services/custom_ssh.xml
----

. Edit the file and specify the new options
+
.Edit the Custom SSH Service Definition
[source,bash]
----

  <description>This is a custom SSH service definition for paranoid people that don't want to run SSH on the default port of 22. This will allow SSH to run on the port 8022 to meet our defined security guidance.</description>

</service>

.FirewallD Delays in Discovering a Service
[CAUTION]
====
Depending on system speed and refreshing of FirewallD daemon, the new service might not be picked up immediately. It will be discovered or if you are in a hurry, you can run *firewall-cmd --reload* command to immediately have the service discovered and available.
====

==== FirewallD Configuration Files

As stated above, the main FirewallD configuration files are located in */etc/firewalld*. To specifically change or view the configuration file on the system, you generally want to look at the firewalls in the *Firewall Zone*. This is found by opening the corresponding zone file in */etc/firewalld/zones* directory.

=== Cockpit

Another change with RHEL 8.x was with the graphical server and the desktop manager. The X11 project and XWindows has been replaced largely with Wayland/Gnome3 as the graphical rendering environment of choice. These changes introduced some dependencies on the graphical management of several system services and components. The Wayland change no longer supports the X11 forwarding, so it was necessary to build tools or extend existing tools to be managed differently. The *cockpit* project was utilized and implemented in RHEL 8 as the new Red Hat Web Management Console which brought in numerous plugins allowing these services to be managed graphically within a standard web browser.

.Red Hat Web Management Console
[IMPORTANT]
====
Leverage portions of the RH354 text around Cockpit and the Red Hat Web Management Console before looking at the additional Cockpit pacakges.
====

==== Installing Additional Cockpit Packages

.Install all Base Cockpit Packages
[source,bash]
----
[root@server ~]# yum install cockpit*
----

image::Chapter3-0692a.png[title="Cockpit Dashboard", align="center"]


.Cockpit Plugin and Package Availability
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using the installation method above will install all Cockpit packages and plugins that are available in currently subscribed channels. However, not all components will work until additional back-end components are installed. For example, the *Composer* cockpit plugins need composer and other items installed in order to be able to be fully utilized. This installation gives the *Cockpit Dashboard Plugin* which allows connecting to multiple Web Consoles.
====


===== Cockpit to Manage Multiple Systems

It is possible to use a single *cockpit* Interface to manage multiple servers.
