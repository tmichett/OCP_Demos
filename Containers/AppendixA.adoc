==  Running Containers



=== Introducing Containers

==== Introducing Container Technology

Containers provide a way to package and deploy applications avoiding package conflicts and dependencies with runtime environments. A container can be a bundled package or packages that are assembled and deployed in a standard way which run isolated from the host system environment.

===== Comparing Containers to Virtual Machines

Containers provide the same benefits as VMs:

* Security
* Storage Isolation
* Network Isolation


image::virtualization-vs-containers.png[title="Virtualization vs. Containers", align="center"]

.Container and Virtualization Differences
[cols="4a,4a",options=header]
|===
|Virtualization
|Container

|Multiple operating systems run on a single hardware platform
|Applications run natively on the operating system and share hardware and OS resources across all containers

|Uses hypervisor to allocate hardware resources into multiple virtual systems
|Shares same OS kernel, but isolates containerized application processes from the rest of the system

|Requires a complete OS in the virtual environment to support the application
|Requires fewer hardware resources allowing for quick start/stop. Also, uses the host OS and any software that is compatible with the kernel.
|===

===== Exploring the Implementation of Containers

Containers use the following core components of Linux:

* *Control Groups (cgroups)* - Used for resource management
* *Namespaces* - Used for process isolation
* *SELinux and Secomp (Secure Computing Mode)* - Used to enforce security boundaries.


===== Planning for Containers

Containers provide reusability and portability for hosted and containerized applications. These containers can easily be moved between environments are are considered temporary. If containers rely on permanent data, persistent storage should be presented to the container.

===== Running Containers from Container Images

Containers are run from *images*. Images serve as blueprints for creating containers.

Container images package an application together with:

* System libraries
* Programming language runtimes and libraries
* Configuration settings
* Static files

Container images are immutable and built according to specifications such as Open Container Initiative (OCI) image format.

===== Designing Container-based Architectures

It is possible to install complex software applications and services in a single container, but it is often harder to manage. Instead, it is recommended to have each component of an application in a container, forming a type of microservices.

==== Managing Containers with Podman

To learn about containers, it is best to work with individual containers on a server which serves as a container host. The *Container Tools* package will provide the OCI tools for RHEL allowing containers to be built and run on the host.

.Container Tools
* *podman* - Manages containers and container images
* *skopeo* - Used to inspect, copy, delete, and sign container images
* *buildah* - Used to create new container images

The tools above are compatible with the OCI and can be used to manage Linux containers created by OCI-compatible container engines such as docker.

===== Running Rootless Containers

The *podman* command is used to run containers as the *root* user or by non-privileged users.  Containers run by non-privileged users are called _rootless containers_.

Rootless containers are more secure but can't do as much, including publishing services through the host's privileged ports (ports below 1024).

.Security Concerns - Running a Container as Root
[IMPORTANT]
====
Containers can be run directly as root, but system security is weakened as an attacker could compromise the container.
====


==== Managing Containers at Scale

Managing containers at scale is extremely difficult. *Kubernetes* was developed as an orchestration service to assist with managing and deploying containers at scale in an enterprise environment. Red Hat provides a Kubernetes distribution called Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP or OCP).






=== Running a Basic Container

==== Installing Container Management Tools

In RHEL8, Container Tools are in the *container-tools* module. The *container-tools* module provides the container tools needed to run containers (specifically *podman*, *skopeo*, and *buildah*).

==== Selecting Container Images and Registries

Container registries are repositories for storing and retrieving container images. Container images are generally uploaded or pushed to a registry by a developer. Images are downloaded or pulled from a container registry to a local system so that the can be used to run containers.

.Red Hat Container Registries
* *registry.redhat.io* - Containers based on official Red Hat products
* *registry.connect.redhat.com* - Containers based on third-party products


.Older Red Hat Registry
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat is phasing out the older *registry.access.redhat.com* container registry in favor of the new container registries.
====

.Red Hat Container Catalog
[TIP]
====
The Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC) is available at https://access.redhat.com/containers and provides a web-based interface for searching container registries for containers.
====

====


===== Container Naming Conventions

Container images are based on a _fully qualified image name_ syntax as follows:

*registry_name/user_name/image_name:tag*

* *registry_name* - Name of registry storing the image.
* *user_name* - Name of user or organization where the image is located
* *image_name* - Name of the image. Must be unique in the user namespace
* *tag* - Identifies image version. If no image tag is provided, it is assumed that the *latest* image tag is used.

==== Running Containers

Before running containers on a system a container image must first be pulled from a registry. Podman can be used to download an image from a container registry using the *podman pull* command.

.Getting the latest UBI Image (Universal Base Image)

----

A container is created and run by using the *podman run* command. When executed, Podman creates and starts a new container based on the container image specified in the command.

.Running the UBI Image
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ podman run --name ubi-demo -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest

----

.*podman run* Options
[NOTE]
====
The *podman run* command supports many options.

* *-t or --tty* - Allocates a *pseudo-tty* (pseudo-terminal) to the container.
* *i or --interactive* - Allows the container to accept standard input.
* *-d or --detach* - Allows the container to run in the background and displays generated container ID.
* *--name* - Allows a name to be specified to the container which must be unique, but allows access to the container with a user generated name rather than a container ID.
====

.Containers Cleanup
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to cleanup containers and images after a container has been run. If a user is wanting to execute a quick command within a container, the *podman run --rm* command can be used in order to execute a command in the container and remove the container once the command has been completed.

[source,bash]

==== Analyzing Container Isolation

Containers provide runtime isolation of resources by utilizing Linux namespaces. Processes running in a container are isolated from all other processes on the host machine.

----

Containers can be restarted if they are *stopped* and will contain the same data. However, if a new container is launched from a container image, any data from the _stopped_ container is not accessible.

Once a container is no longer of use, it should be cleaned up and removed from the system. The *podman rm* command can remove single containers by container name or container ID. It is also possible to use *podman rm -a* to remove all containers. If you want to stop and remove a container, it is possible to use the *--force* to kill a container process so that it can be removed in a single command.

=== Finding and Managing Container Images

==== Configuring Container Registries

Podman uses the *registry.conf* file on the system to retrieve information for container registries. The file is located at */etc/containers/registries.conf*. The list of registries Podman uses are configured in the *[registries.search]* section and the *[registries.insecure]* section of the configuration file.


.Rootless Podman Configuration
[IMPORTANT]
====
The system-wide *registries.conf* file located at  */etc/containers/registries.conf* can be overridden by a user's configuration file located in *$HOME/.config/containers* directory.
====

.Container Image Registries and Searching
[TIP]
====
While it is best practice to specify a fully qualified image, it is possible to provide just an image name on the command line. If an image name is specified, it will search the registries in the listed order to determine which image to select.
====

The *podman info* command can display information about Podman as well as configured registries.

.*podman info* Demo
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ podman info

  arch: amd64

  ... output omitted ...

      Mirrors: null
      Prefix: registry.lab.example.com
    search:
    - registry.lab.example.com
----

===== Registry Security

Insecure registries can be listed in the *[registries.insecure]* section of the *registries.conf* file. If a registry is insecure, that means it is not protected with SSL/TLS encryption. In order for an insecure registry to be searchable, it should exist in both the [registries.search]* section and the *[registries.insecure]* section of the *registries.conf* file.

.Image Repositories Requiring Authentication
[TIP]
====
Some container registries require authentication. In this instance, the *podman login* command can be used to login to a container registry.
====

==== Finding Container Images

The *podman search* command is used to search container registries for a specific container image.

.Using *podman search* to Find UBI7 Image

===== Using the Red Hat Container Catalog

Repositories maintained by Red Hat containing certified container images. The standard *podman* command is compatible with the repositories referenced by the Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC).

==== Inspecting Container Images

Information about images can be obtained before downloading them to the system by using the *skopeo inspect* command to inspect images in a container registry and display information about the image.

.*skopeo inspect*
[TIP]
====
The *skopeo inspect* command can inspect different image formats from multiple sources including remote registries or local directories. The *docker://* transport mechanism instructs skopeo to query a container image registry.
====

This base image is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat and updated regularly.",

... output omitted ..
----

==== Removing Local Container Images

Container images are immutable and do not change. In oder to update software in a container, a new image is created to replace the old image. The newest image will always have the *latest* tag associated with it. As container images are replaced with new images, it becomes necessary for older images to be removed from the system to manage storage and images effectively. The *podman rmi* command can remove and delete the images from the local system. The *podman images* command can be used to list local images, and then the *podman rmi* command can remove the image from the system.

=== Performing Advanced Container Management

==== Administering Containers with Podman

The *podman* command can be used to manage running or stopped containers.

==== Configuring Containers

The *podman run* command can start containers from an image. It can also be used to provide network access, container storage, and pass environment variables and settings to the container instead of modifying the container image.

===== Mapping Container Host Ports to the Container

When a network port on the container host is mapped to a port in the container, network traffic sent to the host port is redirected and received by the container. The *podman run -p* is used to map network ports from the host to a container port. Another reminder is that the *-d* option can cause a container to run in detached mode (daemon / background mode).

.Running Apache and Mapping Network Ports
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ podman run -d -p 8000:8080 --name webdemo registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24
----

.Verifying the Port Mapping
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ podman port -a
0d1d688ebbbd	8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8000
----

.Container Host Firewall
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to note that while there is no firewall service running in the container, the container host must allow the network traffic on whatever port has been forwarded to the container.

.Using FirewallD on Container Host
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8000/tcp
[sudo] password for student:
success
----

A rootless container cannot open ports on the container host below 1024. Ports above 1024 can be mapped from the container host to any port in the container even when running a rootless container.
====

===== Passing Environment Variables to Configure a Container

Environment variables can be used to pass values to a container without modifying the container image. In order to see the environment variables a container image accepts, you can use the *podman inspect* command. There are different ways on obtaining information a container can use ... one is to look at the *URL* which will point to a web page documenting the possible environment variables and how to use the container image.

The other method of determining possible environment variables can be the *usage* portion returned from *podman inspect* as this will often show how to run the container and provide environment variables with the *-e* on the command line.

The *podman run -e VARNAME=Value* will pass environment variables to the container and process this inside the container image.

==== Managing Containers


The *podman ps* command will list running containers while the *podman ps -a* command will list all containers, even if they have been stopped.

.Podman Commands
[cols="4a,4a",options=header]
|===
|Podman Command
|IP addresses

|*podman run*
|Starts a container based on a given container image and accepts other parameters such as *--name* specifying container name, *-d* for daemon/detached mode, *-p* to perform port forwarding, *it* to allow interactive commands, and more.

|*podman stop*
|Stops a container gracefully by name or container ID. The *podman stop --all* can stop all running containers

|*podman rm*
|The *podman rm <ContainerName/ID>* removes the stopped container from the host. Using *podman rm -a* will remove all stopped containers. It is also possible to use the *podman rm -a -f* to force stop and remove containers from the system.

|*podman rmi / podman image rm*
|Removes the specified image from the system.

|*podman restart*
|Restarts a stopped container. Creating a new container with same container ID and reuses the container state and filesystem.

|*podman kill*
|Sends UNIX signals to main process in the container. These signals are the same as those used by the *kill* command.

|===

.Removing a Container and an Image
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is possible to delete an image for a running container if you use the *-f* option with *podman rmi* command. This will stop and remove the containers using the image and it will then delete the image from the local system.
====

.*podman stop* Note
[TIP]
====
The *podman stop* command will attempt to stop the container gracefully, but if the stop command fails, it send a *SIGTERM* and *SIGKILL* signal to the container.
====

==== Running Commands in a Container

In addition to running commands when launching the container with the *-it* option, it is possible to launch an interactive shell in order to debug a container or inspect the contents and other items in a container. The *podman exec* command can be used on a running container to provide an interactive shell within the container.

.Using *podman exec*
[source,bash]
----
[student@servera ~]$ podman exec -it demo /bin/bash
bash-4.4$

bash-4.4$ id
uid=1001(default) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

=== Attaching Persistent Storage to a Container

==== Preparing Permanent Storage Locations

Container storage is _ephemeral_ meaning any data is gone once the container has been removed. If you want data to be persistent and preserved, then you must provide and mount persistent storage to the container.

==== Providing Persistent Storage from the Container Host

The easiest way to provide persistent storage to a container is to use a directory on the container host and mount it to the container for persistent storage. Conceptually, this is similar to adding a remote network volume and mounting it to the host file system. When the container is removed/deleted, files from the persistent storage volume remain on the container host filesystem.

===== Preparing the Host Directory

When providing storage to a container, it must be configured so container processes can access the storage. This generally involves:

* Configuring ownership and directory permissions
* Setting appropriate SELinux contexts

The user account within container application must have access to the host directory. Additionally, SELinux context types should be set for *container_file_t* as podman uses this SELinux context type to control what files on a host system the container can access. This is very important for applicaitons running as *root* inside a root container. Without the SELinux contexts being provided and setup correct, it is possible for the container and application to have *root* access on the host system.

===== Mounting a Volume

After creating and configuring the host directory, it is possible to mount the directory to the container using *--volume or -v* and specifying the *_HostDir_ : _ContainerDir_:Z*  which will automatically apply the SELinux *container_file_t* context type to the host directory.
